this is a anplication I was asked to create. Was told to make a quize game that asked questions about javascript using DOM manipulation.

The first step that I took was to creat a repository and added html file and a javascript file

Created elments like h1 and buttons and set them inside a container.
the reason to Create html elements is so they can be easy to manipulate by
using DOM method

My next step was to assigned variable the targeted the html properties
